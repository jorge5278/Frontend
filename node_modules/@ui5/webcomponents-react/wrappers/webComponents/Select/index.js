/**
 * The `Select` component is used to create a drop-down list.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * There are two main usages of the `ui5-select>`.
 *
 * 1. With Option (`Option`) web component:
 *
 * The available options of the Select are defined by using the Option component.
 * The Option comes with predefined design and layout, including `icon`, `text` and `additional-text`.
 *
 * 2. With OptionCustom (`OptionCustom`) web component.
 *
 * Options with custom content are defined by using the OptionCustom component
 * The OptionCustom component comes with no predefined layout and it expects consumers to define it.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 * The `Select` provides advanced keyboard handling.
 *
 * - [F4] / [Alt] + [Up] / [Alt] + [Down] / [Space] or [Enter] - Opens/closes the drop-down.
 * - [Up] or [Down] - If the drop-down is closed - changes selection to the next or the previous option. If the drop-down is opened - moves focus to the next or the previous option.
 * - [Space], [Enter] - If the drop-down is opened - selects the focused option.
 * - [Escape] - Closes the drop-down without changing the selection.
 * - [Home] - Navigates to first option
 * - [End] - Navigates to the last option
